# GOVNO-ENGINE
My attempt at video game engines using SFML and ImGui.
Unfortunately, there isn't much functionality. It's just my silly project for fun.

# COMPILATION
SFML and ImGui libraries are already in the repo.

# VERSIONS
SFML - 3.0.0  
imgui - 1.91.9  
imgui-sfml - 3.0  
CMAKE - 4.2.0-rc3  

# WINDOWS
All you need to do is:  
- have the gcc 14.2.0+ toolkit installed  
- make sure that compiler folder is included in PATH  
  
# LINUX  
You have to instal EVERYTHING that make_editor links with.  

- ```make/[platform]/make_imgui```, to make the imgui objects  
- ```make/[platform]/make_editor```, if you want to run the editor  
- ```make/[platform]/make_app```, if you want to run the resulting app.  

Good luck figuring out anything in my software.
