# GOVNO-ENGINE
My attempt at video game engines using SFML and ImGui.
Unfortunately, there isn't much functionality. It's just my silly project for fun.

# COMPILATION
SFML and ImGui libraries are already in the repo.

# VERSIONS
SFML - 3.0.0  
imgui - 1.91.9  
imgui-sfml - 3.0  
CMAKE - 4.2.0-rc3  (Ninja, GCC compiler)  

Good luck figuring out anything in my software.
