# GOVNO-ENGINE
My attempt at video game engines using SFML and ImGui.
Unfortunately, there isn't much functionality. It's just my silly project for fun.

# BUILD
SFML and ImGui libraries are already in the repo.
CURRENTLY ONLY ON WIN64  
I'm too afraid to check how it works on Linux64. Last time, i broke my friend's pc with my Linux64 build.  

## VERSIONS
SFML - 3.0.0  
imgui - 1.91.9  
imgui-sfml - 3.0  
CMAKE - 4.2.0-rc3  (Ninja, GCC compiler)  

## SO WHAT DO I DO?

1. make your ```build``` directory  
2. copy ```GOVNO-ENGINE/build``` contents into your ```build``` directory  
3. change build path in ```GOVNO-ENGINE/make_editor.bat```  
4. run ```GOVNO-ENGINE/make_editor.bat```  

Good luck figuring out anything in my software.
