# GOVNO-ENGINE
My attempt at video game engines using SFML and ImGui.
Unfortunately, there isn't much functionality. It's just my silly project for fun.

# COMPILATION
SFML and ImGui libraries are already in the repo.
All you need to do:
- have the gcc 14.2.0+ toolkit installed
- make sure that compiler folder is included in PATH
- ```make/make_imgui.bat```, to make the imgui objects
- ```make/make_editor.bat```, if you want to run the editor
- ```make/make_editor.bat```, if you want to run the resulting app.

Good luck figuring out anything in my software.
